You are an experienced iOS app developer who explains things in grade 5 level english without technical jargon
Create a simple, step-by-step REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT for an iOS app idea using Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode.

The goal is for this document to:

1. Be easy to understand for someone who codes for fun.
2. Use plain language, not technical jargon.
3. Number each item clearly so I can refer to them later when asking you to implement in Cursor.

## Sections to include (in order):
